### Before

 * Read the very friendly Chapter 18 (What's Your Vector, Victor?) on support vector machines from [Introduction to Data Science](http://jsresearch.net/). (It gives its example in `R`.)

Optional:


### Questions

 * Imagine an example dataset with two continuous features corresponding to axes in the plane, and binary label. How well would each of the classification algorithms we've seen so far perform with this data?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.

[Slides](slides.pdf) on support vector machines.

Explain two 'parts' of SVM:
 * maximum margin hyperplane
 * kernel function / kernel trick


### After

Optional:

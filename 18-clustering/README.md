### Before

 * Explore this very nice [k-means IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/temporaer/tutorial_ml_gkbionics/blob/master/2%20-%20KMeans.ipynb) and be very sure to play with the interactive bit at the bottom with the three buttons: "Reset", "Assign", and "Update".

Optional:

 * Read an extensive [chapter](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/ch8.pdf) on clustering.


### Questions

 * In the IPython Notebook reading, how do you mentally cluster the Mickey Mouse dataset? What mental processes are involved?
 * In the IPython Notebook reading, what do the three buttons on the interactive ("Reset", "Assign", "Update") each do?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?

### Before

 * Read this post on [Graphs and their Representation](http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2012/08/31/computer-algorithms-graphs-and-their-representation/) to pick up some terms and the common methods for representating graphs.

Optional:

 * Read this brief [essay](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/) with a simple graph representation and algorithm implementations in Python.
 * Read [Graph-based Features for Supervised Link Prediction](http://www.kaggle.com/blobs/download/forum-message-attachment-files/183/supervised_link_prediction.pdf), a paper on extracting features from graphs for predictive modeling, for a particular example.


### Questions

 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.

[Slides](slides.pdf) on graphs.

Many things can be viewed as graphs even if they aren't obviously graphs to begin with. The transformation is in determining what a node is and what it means to be connected. A not uncommon way to do this is to use co-occurence of words. You could check out a [simple example](http://planspace.org/2013/01/30/visualize-co_occurrence/) using the `igraph` package in `R`.


### After

Optional:

 * For a very gentle and traditional introduction to graphs, check out this [chapter](http://www.mhhe.com/math/ltbmath/bennett_nelson/conceptual/netgraphs/graphs.htm) featuring [PÃ³lya-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It) exercises.
 * For a little more mathematics in connection with network graphs, see [The mathematics of networks](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/papers/palgrave.pdf).

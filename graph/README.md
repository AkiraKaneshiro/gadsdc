### Before

 * Read this brief Python [essay](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/) with a simple graph representation and algorithm.

Optional:

 * Read [Graph-based Features for Supervised Link Prediction](http://www.kaggle.com/blobs/download/forum-message-attachment-files/183/supervised_link_prediction.pdf), a paper on extracting features from graphs for predictive modeling, for a particular example.


### Questions

 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.

[Slides](slides.pdf) on graphs.

Many things can be viewed as graphs even if they aren't obviously graphs to begin with. The transformation is in determining what a node is and what it means to be connected. A not uncommon way to do this is to use co-occurence of words. You could check out a [simple example](http://planspace.org/2013/01/30/visualize-co_occurrence/) using the `igraph` package in `R`.


### After

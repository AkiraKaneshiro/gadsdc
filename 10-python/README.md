### Before

Likely use the Social Web book appendix C, though it has some issues - missing bit on UTF-8, etc.

Possibly mention here or add to further resources: [Datalicious Notebookmania â€“ My favorite 7 IPython Notebooks](http://beautifuldata.net/2014/03/datalicious-notebookmania-my-favorite-7-ipython-notebooks/)

Handy shortcut:

    alias nb='ipython notebook --pylab=inline'

### Before

Strengthen your R skills by reading these sections from [Advanced R programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/):

 * [Introduction](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html)
     * The [Meta-techniques](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html#meta-techniques) sub-section is worth reading twice.
 * [Data Structures](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html)
 * [Subsetting](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Subsetting.html)
 * [Functions](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html)

Optional:

 * Also read the part on functional programming in R.


### During

Application presentation.

[Slides](slides.pdf) on machine learning and KNN.

Distance metrics / [norms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics))
 * Hamming distance (count unequal)
 * taxicab distance / L1 norm
 * Euclidean distance / L2 norm
 * [Cosine similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity)

# How to contribute

All improvements are good improvements! Your fixes and additions are highly appreciated. Here's how to keep things improving:

Private questions/comments/ideas:

 * Reach out to someone directly via email. The github repository owner is a good default choice. You can find that email address easily. However, please also consider the following public options.

Public questions/comments/ideas:

 * Use the github issues system. It's a good idea to `@`mention someone in particular if you want their attention.
 * Please don't leave issues open forever. Issue-rot is bad for everyone. Close your own issue if appropriate, and/or follow up to see about getting it addressed otherwise.
 * Issues are for ideas that you can't do yourself right now, and they can be appropriate for big or controversial changes. However, please also consider just making the change yourself, as below.

Concrete fixes/improvements/additions:

 * The _only_ way that `master` changes is by merging in github pull requests.
     * Even if you are a committer, the _only_ way that `master` changes is by merging in github pull requests - except for truly tiny changes like typo fixes.
 * Therefore, fork the repo on github, preferably then create a topic branch, and when ready submit a nice pull request through the github interface.
 * There's no hard and fast "style guide", but please observe the following:
     * Try to be consistent with existing files. For example, all the class READMEs include certain sections formatted in particular ways.
     * Write github-flavored markdown. Remember that markdown doesn't care much about your single newlines, so what looks like a list in a text editor may not look like a list when viewed on github. Don't leave URLs bare, but write markdown links. Declare the language of code blocks. And so on.
     * Generally, long lines are okay in text. PEP 8 is a good target for Python. PEP 8 is a good spiritual target for Python. The Google R Style Guide is a good spiritual target for R. Write things that look nice.
     * In file names, generally avoid capital letters, never use spaces, and keep it short and meaningful.
     * Never use tabs.

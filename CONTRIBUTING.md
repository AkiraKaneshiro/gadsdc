# How to contribute

Your questions, comments, ideas, fixes, improvements, and additions are highly appreciated! Here's how to keep things going:

Private questions/comments/ideas:

 * Reach out to someone directly via email. The github repository owner is a good default choice. You can find that email address easily. However, please also consider the following public options.

Public questions/comments/ideas:

 * Use the github issues system. It's a good idea to `@`mention someone in particular if you want their attention.
 * Please don't leave issues open forever. Issue-rot is bad for everyone. Close your own issue if appropriate, and/or follow up to see about getting it addressed otherwise.
 * Issues are for ideas that you can't do yourself right now. They can be appropriate for big or controversial changes. However, please also consider just making the change yourself, as below.

Concrete fixes/improvements/additions:

 * Fork the repo on github, create a topic branch, and when ready submit a nice pull request through the github interface.
     * Even if you're a committer, still introduce changes to `master` via github pull requests. You can merge in your own pull request - the purpose is to keep things clear and to notify other committers of your work. The only thing you can skip a PR on would be _very_ minor typo fixes.
 * There's no hard and fast style guide, but please consider the following:
     * Try to be consistent with existing files. For example, all the class READMEs include certain sections formatted in particular ways.
     * In markdown files, write markdown. Remember that markdown doesn't care much about your single newlines, so what looks like a list in a text editor may not look like a list when viewed on github. Don't leave URLs bare, write markdown links. Declare the language of code blocks. And so on.
     * Generally, long lines are okay in text. [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is a good target for Python. [The Google R Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml) is a good target for R. Write things that look nice.
     * In file names, never use spaces, generally avoid capital letters, and keep it short and meaningful.
     * Never use tabs.

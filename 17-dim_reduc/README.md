### Before

Optional:

 * Read [A tutorial on Principal Components Analysis](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc453/student_tutorials/principal_components.pdf) for a very friendly introduction that starts from the very basics.
 * Read the [Stanford PCA Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/PCA), which is just slightly mathier.
 * Read this [step-by-step walk-through](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_pca_step_by_step.html) of PCA with Python.


### Questions

 * Why would we prefer not to have correlated features? For OLS regression, what happens when two features are identical? What happens when they're almost identical (highly correlated)?
 * What are the possible costs/benefits of having more features rather than fewer? What is a "good" number of features?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?

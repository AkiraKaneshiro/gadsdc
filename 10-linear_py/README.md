### Before

 * Read through the [scikit-learn quick-start](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html).
 * Take a peak at the [Machine Learning Cheat Sheet (for scikit-learn)](http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html).

Optional:

 * Read _Chapter 3: Linear Methods for Regression_ from [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print10.pdf) (internal pages 43 to 99, PDF pages 62 to 118).

 * Check out [Linear algebra explained in four pages](http://cnd.mcgill.ca/~ivan/miniref/linear_algebra_in_4_pages.pdf)


### Questions

 * Try to describe "the machine learning process" without reference to
   any particular algorithm(s). What are the generic "objects" and
   "actions" of the process?
 * When coding, do you tend to prefer more fine-grained control over
   details or more high-level abstractions? When is one more useful
   than the other?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have?
   What's on your mind?


### During

Application presentation.

Question review.

[Slides](slides.pdf) on regularization for linear regression.

`glmnet` [demo](glmnet.Rmd).

Introduce the [linear regression assignment](../linear_assignment).

 * Write out a mean squared error function.
 * Experiment with some null models for `SalaryNormalized` - try zeros, and the intercept-only model.
 * Mention the idea of checking some distributions.
 * Use `grep` to hand-dummy some columns based on the text descriptions.
 * Note that the answers are available in `solution.csv` but performance should only be checked there as a _final_ step.

Building up from base Python:
 * `sklearn` ([documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/documentation.html)) and friends

The `sklearn` pattern:
 1. Import a class (make it available)
 2. Instantiate (make one)
 3. Fit (give it data)
 4. Transform/Predict (get results)

Go through the [walk-through](walkthrough.py) together.

Go through the following:

 * [KNN](knn.md)
 * [Linear Regression](linear.md)

These also introduce `patsy`, `statsmodels`, and evaluation/cross-validation with `sklearn`.

 * [`patsy`](http://patsy.readthedocs.org/) (see also: [patsy quick start](https://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html) (see also: [Why's it called "patsy"?](http://seveninchesofyourtime.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/montypython7.gif))
 * [`statsmodels`](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/)


### After

Complete your [linear regression assignment](../linear_assignment). When you're done you'll have a `name.Rmd` (or similar) file in the `linear_assignment` directory of the class repo.

Optional:
 * Read this [glmnet vignette](http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html) for even more about using `R`'s `glmnet` package.
 * The `DAAG` `R` package includes `cv.lm` function which you might investigate. It may or may not be better than using your own.
 * Check out the [intro to scikit-learn][] video series from SciPy2013.
 * Learn more about sklearn by reading [API design for machine learning software: experiences from the scikit-learn project](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0238).
 * Check out "[Datalicious Notebookmania â€“ My favorite 7 IPython Notebooks](http://beautifuldata.net/2014/03/datalicious-notebookmania-my-favorite-7-ipython-notebooks/)".
 * There are other kinds of analyis such as survival analysis which can also be done in Python with, e.g., [lifelines](http://lifelines.readthedocs.org/).

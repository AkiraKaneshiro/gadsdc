### Before

 * Watch the [10-minute tour of pandas](http://vimeo.com/59324550).
 * Read through the [scikit-learn quick-start](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html).

Optional:

 * Go through a brief [Learn pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/raw/master/lessons/01%20-%20Lesson.ipynb) IPython notebook.
 * Take a peak at the [Machine Learning Cheat Sheet (for scikit-learn)](http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.com/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html).


### Questions

 * Try to describe "the machine learning process" without reference to any particular algorithm(s). What are the generic "objects" and "actions" of the process?
 * When coding, do you tend to prefer more fine-grained control over details or more high-level abstractions? When is one more useful than the other?
 * What other thoughts, comments, concerns, and questions do you have? What's on your mind?

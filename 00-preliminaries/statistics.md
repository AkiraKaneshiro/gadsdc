# Statistics Review

Although statistics is not the focus of this course, having a basic grasp of statistics will help you to better understand many of the concepts taught throughout the course. Below are some resources that you might find helpful.

## Basic statistics concepts

These two long pages are a good place to start, for reviewing basic concepts and terminology:

 * [Getting Started with Statistics Concepts](http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Elementary-Statistics-Concepts)
 * [What are Basic Statistics?](http://www.statsoft.com/Textbook/Basic-Statistics)

## Videos and slides from online statistics course

This is a set of relatively short videos and slide decks that Sinan created for an online statistics course. More to come!

## Statistics textbooks

If you enjoy learning from a textbook, or perhaps just want to read more on a specific topic, you might find one of these to be useful:

 * [OpenIntro Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php): A substantial textbook (400+ pages), but readable and highly graphical. The "[Teachers](http://www.openintro.org/stat/teachers.php)" section of the website also has downloadable slides.
 * [Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkstats/): Relatively brief (120 pages), and includes integrated Python exercises.
 * [Open Learning Initiative: Probability & Statistics](http://oli.cmu.edu/courses/free-open/statistics-course-details/): Not actually a textbook, though it reads like a textbook and includes integrated quizzes. Very readable.

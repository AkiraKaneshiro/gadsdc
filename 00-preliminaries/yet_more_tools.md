### Yet More Tool References

These are not my first choices, but they are additional references that you might consider if you dislike those in [tools](tools.md).

For `R`:

 * [R: A self-learn tutorial](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/files/scicomp/Dloads/RProgramming/BestFirstRTutorial.pdf)
 * Germán Rodríguez' [Introducing R]](http://data.princeton.edu/R/)

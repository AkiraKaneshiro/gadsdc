# Light statistical coding warm-ups

The files `warmup.R` and `warmup.py` will let you warm up by using R and Python to write some simple statistical functions. Each file has four assertions that should run without error when the function definitions have been completed.

A very highly prepared student might complete these exercises without any reference to external sources. An average student would likely need to look things up and may be very unfamiliar with one or the other of R or Python. A student who will struggle in the class is unfamiliar with terms like "mean", "variance", "covariance", and "correlation", and is unable to get started by locating helpful online resources.

Here are some questions and extensions to think about:

 * There are at least two significant differences between the R and Python exercises that will result in your implementations being different between the two. What differences have you found, what do they mean, and why might they exist?
 * There are equations that correspond to what you've implemented. Write out the equations. Write out the equations in LaTeX notation.
 * What is the relationship between a squared correlation coefficient and a coefficient of determination? What difference(s) can there be? How would functions implementing the two be similar and different?
 * Write a blog post describing everything you've done.

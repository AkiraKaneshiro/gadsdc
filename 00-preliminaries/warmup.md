# Light statistical coding warm-ups

The files [warmup.R](warmup.R) and [warmup.py](warmup.py) will let you warm up by using R and Python to write some simple statistical functions. Each file has four assertions that should run without error when the function definitions have been completed.

Start out by seeing how far you can get without referring to any external resources! If you hit a stumbling block, or don't know one of the terms or formulas, feel free to search online for help. (Being able to find useful resources to help solve your problem is a necessary data science skill!) And of course, your instructors are also available to help.

Once your functions are complete, here are some optional extensions and questions to think about:

 * See if you can rewrite any of your functions to run faster. There are many things you can try: eliminating intermediate steps, simplifying or eliminating loops, using different data structures, etc. If you're unsure whether your new function runs faster, figure out how to time your functions in R and Python, or just increase the size of your simulated data!
 * There are at least two significant differences between the R and Python exercises that will result in your implementations being different between the two. What differences have you found, what do they mean, and why might they exist?
 * There are equations that correspond to what you've implemented. Write out the equations. Write out the equations in LaTeX notation (highly optional).
 * What is the relationship between a squared correlation coefficient and a coefficient of determination? What difference(s) can there be? How would functions implementing the two be similar and different?
 * Write a blog post describing everything you've done. (Communicating your methods and results is a useful skill to practice!)

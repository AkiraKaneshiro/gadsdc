### Questions

 * Suppose you have features that correspond to length, width, and height, and you're predicting a label which is volume. Could you use KNN? Explain how it could work (with some relevant implementation details), or why it wouldn't work.
 * Suppose you have features that correspond to length, width, and height, and you're predicting a label which is volume. Could you use a Bayesian approach? Explain how it could work (with some relevant implementation details), or why it wouldn't work.

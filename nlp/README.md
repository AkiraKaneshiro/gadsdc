### A stub for Natural Language Processing

 * [Liz Merkhofer's guest lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wv6r2p7lXKepoeX4WIvkqBMThELkI5irQYYtZWfyX70/pub) (presented 2014-09-03)

 * [SENNA](http://ml.nec-labs.com/senna/) is interesting, and [this paper](http://ronan.collobert.com/pub/matos/2011_nlp_jmlr.pdf) seems to be a key one.

(Some/other deep learning things could fit here too.)

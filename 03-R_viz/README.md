### Before

Read this blog post, which is an adequate brief summary of Tufte: [Data Visualization Principles: Lessons from Tufte](http://moz.com/blog/data-visualization-principles-lessons-from-tufte)

Optional:

 * Watch this presentation about [looking at your data](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coNDCIMH8bk).
 * Read this chapter from the Bad Data Handbook: "Is it just me, or does this data smell funny?"
 * These [slides](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~tgirke/HTML_Presentations/Manuals/Rgraphics/Rgraphics.pdf) include some good examples of the graphics functions we'll use, and more.


### During

Application presentation.

Take a look at the Juice Labs [Chart Chooser](http://labs.juiceanalytics.com/chartchooser/) and gallery.

R base graphics: `plot`, `plot(sort())`, (`abline`, `points`, `text`, ...), `hist`, `boxplot`, `barplot`, <s>`pie`</s>, `dotchart`, (`image`, `contour`, `persp`), `pairs`, (`qqnorm`, `qqplot`), and `par`. (Use the help, and use the examples.)

Experiment with the [combinatoric intro to `ggplot`](ggplot.md).

Write graphics to disk with `png()` and friends, followed by `dev.off()`.

Make a lot of visualizations of your data. Choose one and post it to twitter (#gadsdc).

Some presentations.


### After

Optional:

 * You should really go to the source on Tufte, but that means you need to get his books. Start with [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142). I also especially like Tufte on PowerPoint, which you might even be able to find online.
 * On a similar level to Tufte, with more focus on scientific graphics, check out William Cleveland's books, e.g., [Visualizing Data](http://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Data-William-S-Cleveland/dp/0963488406/).
 * If you've read Tufte and Cleveland, perhaps check out [Stephen Few](http://www.amazon.com/Stephen-Few/e/B001H6IQ5M).

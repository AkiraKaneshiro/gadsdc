# Application Presentations

This mini-project aims to introduce you to interesting applications and sub-topics of machine learning and data science more broadly. You will research and present briefly on your topic, becoming a relative expert. Your classmates will research and present on their topics so that you may learn from them. This process should expand your appreciation of various ways that data science is applied and help you to think about ways that you can apply what you're learning for your final project.

You can choose from the [starter list of applications](applications.md) or choose an application that you discover independently, as long as you don't duplicate anyone else's topic.

Your presentation should be roughly five minutes long, light weight in terms of setup and tear-down, and hopefully interesting. You will likely want to include:

 * Who is involved? (A person? A company?)
 * What is the problem that's being addressed?
 * What data is available and/or being used?
 * What techniques are being developed/applied? (This could be difficult where not much detail is shared - if you have to, you can speculate about techniques that might be applied.)
 * How does the application relate to other topics of the class?
 * How does the application relate to the world? What are the implications? (Opportunities? Risks?)

Application Presentations will be delivered at the beginning of class, so be sure to be prepared!

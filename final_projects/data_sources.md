> Where can I find some data?

You may already have data that you're interested in working with. You may have an idea for scraping web data from some source, or for using data from an API such as Twitter's. There are lots of sources of data!

 * There are a variety of open data catalogs from various governments:
     * [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/)
     * [DC Data Catalog](http://data.dc.gov/) / [OpenDataDC](http://www.opendatadc.org/)
     * [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
     * [data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk/)
 * Of course there are more traditional government and NGO data sources:
     * [The US Census](http://www.census.gov/)
     * [Data from the World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/)
 * Academic institutions host a variety of data set collections:
     * The [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) makes available a variety of nice data sets.
     * [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)
     * [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/)
     * [The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Centerâ€™s DataShop](http://www.learnlab.org/technologies/datashop/)
 * [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com/) provides data sets with their challenges, though you won't be able to get their test sets.
 * If you're interested in working with a large data set, Amazon has a variety of [public data sets](http://aws.amazon.com/publicdatasets/) that are available through their infrastructure, including Common Crawl and 1000 Genomes.

This is just the tip of the iceberg; there's a lot of data out there!

# Final project task: Elevator pitch

Prepare a 30-second "elevator pitch" describing your project. (This
could be just a current project idea if you aren't sure what you're
working on yet, but you should have some idea.) Get a `name.md` file
into the `project-pitch` directory of the class repo. We'll share
these elevator pitches in class. Keep working on your project!

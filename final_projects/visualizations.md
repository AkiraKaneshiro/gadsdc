# Final project task: Visualization

Prepare three visualizations based on your final project data. Each
one should show the viewer something about the data - the viewer
should know something more, hopefully something interesting, after
viewing the visualization. Clear labels will be important. You can use
`R` or `python` (or both) and include code (including R markdown
and/or IPython Notebooks) but you should also produce image files that
can be viewed separately. Leave your image and source files in the
`project-viz` directory of the class repo. It would be good to name your
files something consistent, like `name01.png`, `name02.png`, `name.R`,
etc. The purpose of submitting image files in this way is so that they
can be easily viewed all together when they are presented.

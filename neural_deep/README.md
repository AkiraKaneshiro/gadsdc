Fun deep learning [products](https://www.jetpac.com/deepbelief) from Jetpac, including an [in-browser demo](https://www.jetpac.com/deepbeliefdemo).

[deeplearning.net](http://deeplearning.net/) has a lot of resources collected nicely.

An available book is Microsoft's [Deep Learning: Methods and Applications](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209355/NOW-Book-Revised-Feb2014-online.pdf) (free PDF).

There is a popular [Deep Learning Google Plus Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/112866381580457264725).

### During

Example: [Ranking DC tech companies based on github data](http://datacommunitydc.org/blog/2013/12/ranking-dc-software-companies-for-fun-and-employment/)

Go through the [walking introduction to R](walking_intro.Rmd).

Also refer to the [shortest introduction to R](http://planspace.org/2014/01/01/the-shortest-introduction-to-r-2/).

Pair up and write FizzBuzz in R.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

Discuss the Monty Hall problem and the value of simulation. Switch sides in pairs and write a Monty Hall problem simulator in R.

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Solve problem 8 from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/). Solve more, if you like!
